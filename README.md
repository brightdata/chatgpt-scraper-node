ChatGPT answers as JSON, in JavaScript: send a prompt, get back the answer ChatGPT
shows in its own interface, as text, Markdown and HTML, with the sites it
cited, by country, with web search and follow-up prompts. Built for ChatGPT
visibility tracking and GEO: which brands ChatGPT mentions and recommends, and
which sources it cites. No OpenAI API key, no browser, no dependencies. Built on the
[Bright Data ChatGPT Scraper API](https://brightdata.com/products/web-scraper/chatgpt?utm_source=github).

Also here: a one-command CLI for a list of prompts, and the
[Bright Data CLI](#chatgpt-mcp-server-and-claude-code-skill), which needs no JavaScript at all.

## How to scrape ChatGPT results with Node.js

Node 20 or newer, and nothing to install: this is the built-in `fetch`. Save
it as a `.mjs` file, since it uses top-level `await`.

```bash
export BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Get a token from the
[Bright Data control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users). No
account yet? [Create one](https://brightdata.com/cp/start); new accounts get
[5,000 free credits a month](https://docs.brightdata.com/general/account/billing-and-pricing/free-tier).

```javascript
const API = "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3";
const HEADERS = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN}`,
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
};

async function call(path, body) {
  const init = body === undefined ? { headers: HEADERS } : { method: "POST", headers: HEADERS, body: JSON.stringify(body) };
  const response = await fetch(API + path, init);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${await response.text()}`);
  return response.json();
}

const prompt = {
  url: "https://chatgpt.com/",
  prompt: "Best CRM software for small businesses",
  country: "US",
  web_search: true,
};
const job = await call("/trigger?dataset_id=gd_m7aof0k82r803d5bjm&include_errors=true", [prompt]);
while (!["ready", "failed"].includes((await call(`/progress/${job.snapshot_id}`)).status)) {
  await new Promise((done) => setTimeout(done, 10_000));
}
const [answer] = await call(`/snapshot/${job.snapshot_id}?format=json`);
if (answer.error) throw new Error(answer.error);
console.log(answer.answer_text.slice(0, 120));
for (const citation of (answer.citations ?? []).slice(0, 3)) console.log("cited:", citation.url);
```

```

Expect one to five minutes: the API asks ChatGPT and the loop waits for the
answer. One run with web search and sources took eleven. Billed
[per answer](https://brightdata.com/pricing/web-scraper).

Three things in that snippet are not optional.

`url` must be `https://chatgpt.com/`. The scraper requires it on every input;
the prompt goes in `prompt`.

`web_search: true` asks ChatGPT to search the web, which is what usually
brings citations. Without it, `citations` can come back `null` rather than an
empty list, so the loop guards for that.

`include_errors=true` makes the API report a failed prompt as a row with an
`error` key. The API default is off.

The Bright Data [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/brightdata/sdk-js) wraps this scraper, but its input type has no `require_sources`, so it cannot ask ChatGPT to cite. Hence the
plain HTTP, here and in this package.

## Scrape ChatGPT without an OpenAI API key

The ChatGPT Scraper API needs no OpenAI account, no OpenAI API key and no
ChatGPT login. The only credential is a Bright Data API key, set as
`BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`. This package and its command also find the key stored
by `bdata login`.

It returns what a person sees in ChatGPT itself, not what the OpenAI API
returns: the answer with its citations, links, shopping and map blocks, as
ChatGPT renders them for that country.

## Bulk ChatGPT prompt scraper CLI

The command in this repo runs the quickstart for several prompts at once and
writes one JSON file.

```bash
npm install -g github:brightdata/chatgpt-scraper-node
chatgpt-scraper "Best CRM software for small businesses" "Best project management tool for startups" --web-search
```

```
Asking ChatGPT 2 prompt(s) from US, with web search
Usually one to five minutes each. Billed per answer, 5,000 free credits a month.
asking  "Best CRM software for small businesses"...
got     "Best CRM software for small businesses": 3,335 characters, 11 citations
asking  "Best project management tool for startups"...
got     "Best project management tool for startups": 4,842 characters, 9 citations

Saved 2 answers as JSON to chatgpt.json
```

In a terminal the `asking` lines are replaced by a spinner and a running
clock, updating in place, so you can see it is working and how long it has
been going.

```
--country CC   two-letter country ChatGPT answers from, default US
--web-search   ask ChatGPT to search the web before answering
--out PATH     output file, default chatgpt.json
```

The command finds the token in `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`, or, if you ran
`npx -p @brightdata/cli bdata login` once, in the stored login, for you and
for any coding agent in that terminal. It does not read a `.env` file; Node
loads one for it with `node --env-file=.env`.

Import it instead of running it, for `ok` and `error` per prompt instead of
raw rows. This package is ESM, so use `import`, not `require`. `scrape` never rejects
for one bad prompt; check `ok` before reading `answer`:

```javascript
import { scrape } from "@brightdata/chatgpt-scraper-node";

for (const outcome of await scrape(["Best running shoes for beginners", "Best free photo editing app"])) {
  if (outcome.ok) console.log(`${outcome.prompt}: ${outcome.answer.answer_text.slice(0, 60)}`);
  else console.log(`${outcome.prompt} failed: ${outcome.error}`);
}
```

```

```

## Scrape ChatGPT answers, citations and sources

There is one ChatGPT scraper, documented in the
[ChatGPT Scraper API docs](https://docs.brightdata.com/products/scrapers/chatgpt/introduction).
Every snippet below is complete: paste it as is after the `npm install`
above. Every one of them runs in Actions each Monday, a smaller check runs
every other day, and the badge at the top is the latest result.

| you want | how |
| --- | --- |
| ChatGPT's answer to prompts | `ask(["prompt one", "prompt two"], { country: "US" })` |
| the sites ChatGPT cites | `ask(prompt, { web_search: true, require_sources: true })` |
| a follow-up in the same chat | `ask(prompt, { additional_prompt: "..." })` |
| the answer from another country | `ask(prompt, { country: "DE" })` |
| the answer as Markdown | `answer_text_markdown` on any answer |

`ask` takes one prompt or an array. An array is one job, not one per prompt.
Each answer is one record, and a prompt the API could not answer comes back
as a row with an `error` key. Any other input the API accepts goes in as the
API names it, such as `index`.

### Track ChatGPT citations and brand visibility for a prompt

```javascript
import { ask } from "@brightdata/chatgpt-scraper-node";

const [answer] = await ask("Best project management software for remote teams", { web_search: true, require_sources: true });
const domains = (answer.citations ?? []).map((c) => new URL(c.url).host);
const unique = [...new Set(domains)].sort();
console.log(domains.length, "citations from", unique.length, "sites:");
for (const domain of unique.slice(0, 5)) console.log(" ", domain, domains.filter((d) => d === domain).length);
```

```
9 citations from 8 sites:
  asana.com 2
  basecamp.com 1
  clickup.com 1
  monday.com 1
  thedigitalprojectmanager.com 1
```

`require_sources` asks ChatGPT to cite, and `web_search` makes it look.
`citations` holds each cited `url` with its `title`; `links_attached` holds the
links inside the answer text. Asking the same prompt every day is how GEO
tools track share of citations over time.

### Ask ChatGPT a follow-up prompt

```javascript
import { ask } from "@brightdata/chatgpt-scraper-node";

const [answer] = await ask("Name three popular sourdough bread recipes", {
  additional_prompt: "Which of them is easiest for a beginner? One sentence.",
});
console.log("first: ", answer.answer_text.slice(0, 80));
console.log("second:", answer.additional_answer_text.slice(0, 80));
```

```
first:  Here are three popular sourdough bread recipes worth trying: 1. Classic Artisan 
second: The classic artisan country sourdough is easiest for a beginner because it uses 
```

The follow-up runs in the same chat, so it can refer to the first answer. Its
answer lands in `additional_answer_text`, with its own
`citations_additional_prompt`.

### Compare ChatGPT answers by country

```javascript
import { ask } from "@brightdata/chatgpt-scraper-node";

for (const country of ["US", "DE"]) {
  const [answer] = await ask("Which supermarket chain has the cheapest groceries?", { country, web_search: true });
  console.log(country, "|", answer.answer_text.slice(0, 90));
}
```

```
US | Aldi is generally the cheapest traditional supermarket chain in the U.S. , with Lidl a ver
DE | If you're shopping in Germany , my recommendation is ALDI or Lidl for consistently afforda
```

`country` is the two-letter country ChatGPT answers from. The US answer led
with Aldi; the German one with ALDI and Lidl. `geolocation` is also accepted, but on
9 Nov 2026 coordinates for Midtown Manhattan got an answer about Houston that
began "Since your precise location isn't available", so this package does not
document it.

### Get ChatGPT's answer as Markdown

```javascript
import { writeFile } from "node:fs/promises";

import { ask } from "@brightdata/chatgpt-scraper-node";

const [answer] = await ask("Explain what a REST API is, with one short code example");
const markdown = answer.answer_text_markdown;
await writeFile("answer.md", markdown, "utf8");
const lines = markdown.split("\n");
const headings = lines.filter((line, i) => /^-+$/.test(lines[i + 1] ?? "") && line.trim());
console.log(markdown.length, "characters saved to answer.md; headings:", headings);
```

```
1900 characters saved to answer.md; headings: [
  'How does a REST API work?',
  'Short code example',
  'Key concept to remember'
]
```

`answer_text_markdown` is converted from the rendered page: headings are
underlined with dashes rather than written with `#`, tables are pipe tables,
and code is indented four spaces under a line naming the language, not
fenced. `answer_text` is the same answer as plain text, and `answer_html` the
full page, about 1.4 MB.

### Trigger now, fetch later

For a long list of prompts, do not block a process for an hour. Trigger, keep
the snapshot id, fetch when ready. Snapshots stay downloadable for 30 days.

```javascript
import { CHATGPT, fetchSnapshot, status, trigger } from "@brightdata/chatgpt-scraper-node";

const item = { url: "https://chatgpt.com/", prompt: "What is the capital of Australia?", country: "US" };
const snapshot = await trigger(CHATGPT, [item]);
console.log("snapshot:", snapshot);
let state;
while (!["ready", "failed"].includes((state = await status(snapshot)))) {
  await new Promise((done) => setTimeout(done, 10_000));
}
console.log("status:", state);
console.log("fetched:", (await fetchSnapshot(snapshot))[0].answer_text.slice(0, 60));
```

```
snapshot: sd_mw9canbkoi5uoia7a
status: ready
fetched: The capital of Australia is Canberra . 🇦🇺 It is located in
```

The input fields the live API accepted on 2026-11-09, for dataset
`gd_m7aof0k82r803d5bjm`:

| input | required | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | yes | always `https://chatgpt.com/` |
| `prompt` | yes | the question |
| `country` | no | two-letter country ChatGPT answers from |
| `web_search` | no | `true` asks ChatGPT to search the web |
| `require_sources` | no | `true` asks ChatGPT to cite sources |
| `additional_prompt` | no | a follow-up in the same chat |
| `index` | no | your own number, returned on the record |
| `geolocation` | no | `"lat,long"`; not honoured in our tests |

`bdata pipelines info gd_m7aof0k82r803d5bjm collect_by_url` prints the input
fields the API validates.

## ChatGPT answer data fields (JSON)

The fields most people want from an answer:

```
prompt  answer_text  answer_text_markdown  citations  links_attached  country  web_search_triggered
```

`web_search_triggered` does not follow the `web_search` input: on
9 Nov 2026 it read `false` for an answer with ten citations and `true` for a
prompt sent without `web_search`. `model` was `null` on every record. The code
hardcodes no field list. Whatever the API returns lands in each record, and
in the command's file.

<!-- fields:start -->
Regenerated every day from the published schema,
[scrapers-full.json](https://docs.brightdata.com/scrapers-full.json), so they cannot go stale. A record

## ChatGPT scraper errors

| you see | what it means |
| --- | --- |
| `API token required but not found.` | Exit 2, before any request. Set the token, or run `bdata login`. |
| `failed  "prompt": ...` | Exit 1. The API returned an error row for that prompt instead of an answer. The message is the API's. |
| `failed  "prompt": timeout: snapshot ... not ready after 900s` | Exit 1. Run it again, or fetch the snapshot later with `fetchSnapshot()`. |
| `failed  "prompt": HTTP 401: ...` | The token is set but wrong. |

Any failure exits 1, so a run is safe to gate a script on.

From the functions, the same conditions look like this:

| you see | what it means |
| --- | --- |
| `TokenMissing` | No `BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN` and no `bdata login`. |
| `ApiError: HTTP 400: ...validation_error...` | An input the API does not accept. The message names the field. |
| a row with an `error` key | The API's answer for one prompt. The other rows are fine. |
| `ApiError: timeout: ...` | The job outlived the 900-second wait. Pass `{ timeoutMs }` to `run`, or use `trigger` and fetch later. |

## ChatGPT MCP server and Claude Code skill

No JavaScript, nothing installed. Paste both lines; the first opens a browser
once, or use `bdata login --device` over SSH and in CI:

```bash
npx -p @brightdata/cli bdata login
npx -p @brightdata/cli bdata pipelines run gd_m7aof0k82r803d5bjm collect_by_url --url "https://chatgpt.com/" --prompt "Best CRM software for small businesses" --country US --pretty
```

1 record, 19 fields, 75 seconds on 9 Nov 2026. The CLI leaves out fields that
are null. The record is about 3 MB of JSON, mostly `answer_html`.

`npx skills add brightdata/skills` teaches Claude Code, Cursor and Codex these
commands and the docs, so plain language works afterwards. Full guide:
